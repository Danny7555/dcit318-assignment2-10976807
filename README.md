# C# Projects

This repository demonstrates key concepts in object-oriented programming:

1. **Inheritance and Method Overriding**
2. **Abstract Classes and Methods**
3. **Interfaces**

**Inheritance and Method Overriding**
A base class Animal defines a generic MakeSound() method.
Derived classes Dog and Cat inherit from Animal and override MakeSound() to provide specific sounds.

**Abstract Classes and Methods**
An abstract class Shape defines an abstract GetArea() method that derived classes must implement.
Derived classes Circle and Rectangle implement GetArea() to calculate their respective areas.

**Interfaces**
An interface IMovable defines a Move() method.
Classes Car and Bicycle implement IMovable and provide their own implementations for Move().

**Running the Code:**
This project includes code examples for each concept. Compile and run the code to see the expected behavior.
